Given that our project is focused on Medicine, we believe it may bring benefits in terms of diagnostic accuracy, improved decision-making, and personalized treatment.

Throughout this chapter, we will discuss topics such as the traceability of participants in the data collection campaign, as well as the explainability and transparency of the final AI system.

After assigning tasks to the group members, we began working on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, performing various types of analysis and data cleaning with the aim of improving the quality of information provided to classification models.

Although we were not involved in the stage with direct patient interaction, we chose to reflect on and plan how we would approach the most ethically sensitive aspects if we were responsible for the entire public data collection process.

We would take into account the potential involvement of personal data in medical contexts, applying strict principles of data minimization and anonymization to ensure that only essential information is collected, thus safeguarding participant privacy.

Following this process, we would utilize de-identification techniques and data protection policies to ensure confidentiality and data security, as well as a clear procedure for data deletion (right to be forgotten), so that patients would retain control over their data.

We would also consider potential biases in training data to ensure fairness. Additionally, we would provide intuitive instructions for the reproducibility of the results obtained.

Within the `report.ipynb` and `model_selection.ipynb` documents, several additional issues identified during the development of this project are presented. Detailed analyses and explanations are provided in the conclusion sections of both files.
