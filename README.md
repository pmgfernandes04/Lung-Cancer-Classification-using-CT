# Lung Cancer Classification using CT

This project focuses on classifying lung cancer using Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, specifically in DICOM file format. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying lung cancer based on the provided medical imaging data.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

To handle the high-dimensional nature of CT scan data, we extracted both 2D and 3D features using specialized libraries. Key steps in this process included:

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - We used **PyLidc** to process and annotate the lung nodule data, allowing us to identify regions of interest within the scans.
   - **SimpleITK (sitk)** was used to handle DICOM files and facilitate the extraction of 3D volumetric features.
   - Preprocessing also included resizing and normalization to standardize the data for model input.
   - 
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **2D Feature Extraction**: Extracted features from 2D cross-sections of the CT images, including texture and shape features.
   - **3D Feature Extraction**: Extracting features for 3D input, was fine-tuned to capture complex volumetric patterns in the data, which are critical for accurate lung cancer classification.
   - **ResNet-18** for 3D feature extraction, already pre-trained to handle medical images.

### Model Training

The model pipeline includes a stacking ensemble of various base models, including:

- Additional machine learning models (e.g., **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine**, **XGBoost**) were incorporated into a stacked ensemble, aiming to combine complementary strengths and improve the final predictive performance.

The ensemble was trained on labeled CT data and validated through cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

### Evaluation on External Dataset (LungX)

We evaluated the model's performance on an external dataset, *LungX*, to test its generalizability. Unfortunately, an oversight during feature extraction led to incomplete normalization, which impaired the modelâ€™s ability to accurately classify cases on the new dataset. Therefore, we only report the performance on the primary LIDC dataset.

### Ethical Considerations

In developing a medical diagnostic model, we carefully considered the ethical implications:

- **Patient Privacy**: All data was handled in compliance with privacy laws and guidelines, such as HIPAA, to ensure patient confidentiality and data security.
- **Clinical Safety**: Recognizing that machine learning models can impact patient diagnosis, ensured that the objective of the project is to aid the decision of a professional, but not decide by itself.
- **Among others**

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning for early lung cancer detection from CT scans, emphasizing an effective feature extraction, to create a model that performs well.
